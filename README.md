# TASK2-ranadom-password-generator
This code snippet demonstrates a Python function called generate_password that generates a random password based on user-specified parameters. The function takes four boolean parameters to indicate whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols in the generated password, and an integer parameter to specify the length of the password.

The function first creates a list of characters to use in the password based on the user's selections. It then generates a password of the specified length using the random.choices method from the Python standard library.

The code then prompts the user to input the desired password length and character types to include. It passes these values to the generate_password function to generate the password. Finally, the generated password is printed to the console.

Overall, this code provides a simple and customizable way for users to generate secure passwords.
